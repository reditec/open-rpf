# OpenRPF
OpenRPF is a tool to view RAGE Package Files (*.rpf) and their contents.
OpenRPF can also be used to extract (compressed) files from the RPF archives.
Currently the tool only supports RPF version 0 (as used in Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis).
OpenRPF has been tested successfully with files from the Xbox360 version of Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis.
The tool is not under active development at the moment.
